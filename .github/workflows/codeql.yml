# CodeQL Advanced Security Analysis
# 
# This workflow performs advanced CodeQL security scanning.
# 
# IMPORTANT: If you have GitHub's default code scanning enabled in repository settings,
# you must disable it to use this custom workflow, or this workflow will conflict.
# To disable default setup: Settings > Code security and analysis > Code scanning > 
# Configure > Disable default setup
#
# Alternatively, this workflow is configured to run only on schedule to avoid conflicts
# with default setup that runs on push/pull_request events.
